<Section sectionTitle="About Me">
  <p>
    ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am Yonatan Ginsburg, a junior at Yeshiva University working
    towards a B.S. degree in Computer Science, with a focus in Distributed
    Systems. I want to use my skills to create things that help people. I am
    mostly interested in the backend, but frontend development also interests
    me. Hobbies include the piano & melodica.
